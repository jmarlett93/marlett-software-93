# Marlett Software 93

This project is an  [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) micro app deployed to github pages for my 
personal website. I use this app to test out new technologies from little things like Canvas and CSS shenanigans 
to beefier application processes such as service workers. 

## Build

Run 

> ng build --prod --output-path docs --base-href /marlett-software-93/ 

to cut a release configuration for GitHub pages. Make a copy of index.html named 404.html and save to docs folder. 
Push master branch.
