# Marlett Software 93

This project is an  [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) micro app deployed to github pages for my 
personal website. I use this app to test out new technologies from little things like Canvas and CSS shenanigans 
to beefier application processes such as service workers.
